GoBank has been asked to go back and reprocess the loan payments for a car loan of $18,875. The car loan is a 0% interest loan. The loan is for 60 months. The customer does not believe the bank has the correct outstanding balance for her loan ($12,500). The customer has copies of 20 payments made to the bank. A clerk makes a copy of the payments and enters them into a file.

To verify the banks total, read the file and fevelop a program using a CarLoan class that extends the BankAccount class (found on page 671 â€“ 672 in the textbook).

The CarLoan class has the following features.

<em>1)</em> An overload constructor that initializes the car loan balance. <em>(Hint: Uses super to set the balance.)</em>

<strong>develop a CarLoanClient class that</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Create CarLoan object (see CheckingAccountClient line 9 on page 667).</li>

 <li>Read the file one payment at a time <em>(Include exception handling code see example on page 755</em>).</li>

 <li>Use the payment read from the file to pass the information to method to calculate the outstanding balance. <em>Hint: Use the withdrawal method.</em></li>

 <li>Printout the payment number, payment amount and outstanding balance.</li>

 <li>Continue to process for each payment until the end of the file.</li>

</ol>

develop a text file with the following numbers.
